# LINUX SPECIFIC OPTIONS

# This is the subsystem type. Valid options on Linux:

# "openvz"         - Linux OpenVZ
# "prefix"         - Prefix
# "uml"            - Usermode Linux
# "vserver"        - Linux vserver
# "systemd-nspawn" - container created by the systend-nspawn utility
# "xen0"           - Xen0 Domain
# "xenU"          - XenU Domain
# If this is commented out, automatic detection will be used.
#
# This should be set to the value representing the environment this file is
# PRESENTLY in, not the virtualization the environment is capable of.
#rc_sys=""

# This is the number of tty's used in most of the rc-scripts (like
# consolefont, numlock, etc ...)
rc_tty_number=12

# CGROUPS RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

# If you have cgroups turned on in your kernel, this switch controls
# whether or not a group for each controller is mounted under
# /sys/fs/cgroup.
# None of the other options in this section work if this is set to "NO".
#rc_controller_cgroups="YES"

# The following settings allow you to set up values for the cgroup
# controllers for your services.
# They can be set in this file;, however, if you do this, the settings
# will apply to all of your services.
# If you want different settings for each service, place the settings in
# /etc/conf.d/foo for service foo.
# The format is to specify the names of the settings followed by their
# values. Each variable can hold multiple settings.
# For example, you would use this to set the cpu.shares setting in the
# cpu controller to 512 for your service.
# rc_cgroup_cpu="
# cpu.shares 512
# "
#
#For more information about the adjustments that can be made with
#cgroups, see Documentation/cgroups/* in the linux kernel source tree.

# Set the blkio controller settings for this service.
#rc_cgroup_blkio=""

# Set the cpu controller settings for this service.
#rc_cgroup_cpu=""

# Add this service to the cpuacct controller (any value means yes).
#rc_cgroup_cpuacct=""

# Set the cpuset controller settings for this service.
#rc_cgroup_cpuset=""

# Set the devices controller settings for this service.
#rc_cgroup_devices=""

# Set the memory controller settings for this service.
#rc_cgroup_memory=""

# Set the net_prio controller settings for this service.
#rc_cgroup_net_prio=""

# Set this to YES if yu want all of the processes in a service's cgroup
# killed when the service is stopped or restarted.
# This should not be set globally because it kills all of the service's
# child processes, and most of the time this is undesirable. Please set
# it in /etc/conf.d/<service>.
# To perform this cleanup manually for a stopped service, you can
# execute cgroup_cleanup with /etc/init.d/<service> cgroup_cleanup or
# rc-service <service> cgroup_cleanup.
# rc_cgroup_cleanup="NO"
