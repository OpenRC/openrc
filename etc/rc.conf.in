# Global OpenRC configuration settings

# Set to "YES" if you want the rc system to try and start services
# in parallel for a slight speed improvement. When running in parallel we
# prefix the service output with it's name as the output will get
# jumbled up.
# WARNING: whilst we have improved parallel, it can still potentially lock
# the boot process. Don't file bugs about this unless you can supply
# patches that fix it without breaking other things!
rc_parallel="NO"

# Set rc_interactive to "YES" and you'll be able to press the I key during
# boot so you can choose to start specific services. Set to "NO" to disable
# this feature.
rc_interactive="YES"

# Do we allow any started service in the runlevel to satisfy the depedency
# or do we want all of them regardless of state? For example, if net.eth0
# and net.eth1 are in the default runlevel then with rc_depend_strict="NO"
# both will be started, but services that depend on 'net' will work if either
# one comes up. With rc_depend_strict="YES" we would require them both to
# come up.
rc_depend_strict="YES"

# Do we allow services to be hotplugged? If not, set to rc_hotplug="NO"
# NOTE: This does not affect anything hotplug/udev/devd related, just the
# starting/stopping of the init.d service triggered by it.
rc_hotplug="YES"

# Dynamic /dev managers can trigger coldplug events which cause services to
# start before we are ready for them. If this happens, we can defer these
# services to start in the boot runlevel. Set rc_coldplug="NO" if you don't
# want this.
# NOTE: This also affects module coldplugging in udev-096 and higher
# If you want module coldplugging but not coldplugging of services then you
# can set rc_coldplug="YES" and rc_plug_services="!*"
rc_coldplug="YES"

# Some people want a finer grain over hotplug/coldplug. rc_plug_services is a
# list of services that are matched in order, either allowing or not. By
# default we allow services through as rc_coldplug/rc_hotplug has to be YES
# anyway.
# Example - rc_plug_services="net.wlan !net.*"
# This allows net.wlan and any service not matching net.* to be plugged.
rc_plug_services=""

# rc_logger launches a logging daemon to log the entire rc process to
# /var/log/rc.log
rc_logger="NO"

# By default we filter the environment for our running scripts. To allow other
# variables through, add them here. Use a * to allow all variables through.
# rc_env_allow="VAR1 VAR2"

# MISC CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
# There variables are shared between many init scripts

# Set unicode to YES to turn on unicode support for keyboards and screens.
unicode="NO"

# Network fstypes. Below is the default.

# SERVICE CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
# These variables are documented here, but should be configured in
# /etc/conf.d/foo for service foo and NOT enabled here unless you
# really want them to work on a global basis.

# Some daemons are started and stopped via start-stop-daemon.
# We can set some things on a per service basis, like the nicelevel.
#export SSD_NICELEVEL="-19"

# Pass ulimit parameters 
#rc_ulimit="-u 30"

# It's possible to define extra dependencies for services like so
#rc_config="/etc/foo"
#rc_need="openvpn"
#rc_use="net.eth0"
#rc_after="clock"
#rc_before="local"
#rc_provide="!net"

# You can also enable the above commands here for each service. Below is an
# example for service foo.
#rc_foo_config="/etc/foo"
#rc_foo_need="openvpn"
#rc_foo_after="clock"

# You can also remove dependencies.
# This is mainly used for saying which servies do NOT provide net.
#rc_net_tap0_provide="!net"
