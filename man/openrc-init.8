.Sh NAME
.Nm openrc-init
.Nd the parent of all processes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op runlevel
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an init process which can be an alternative to sysvinit or any other
init process.
.Pp
To use
.Nm
configure your boot loader to invoke it or symlink it to /sbin/init.
Also, you will need to use
.Xr openrc-shutdown 8 ,
to halt, reboot or poweroff the system.
.Pp
The default runlevel is read from the init command line, the
rc_default_runlevel setting in rc.conf, the kernel command line, or it is
assumed to be "default" if it is not set in any of these places.
.Pp
.Nm
doesn't manage getty's directly, so you will need to manage them another
way. For example, you can use the agetty service script as described in
agetty-guide.md in this distribution.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Va EINFO_QUIET
is honored by openrc-init. When set to true, it won't print anything to stdout.
.Pp
.Sh BUGS
This was first released as part of OpenRC 0.25.
I do not know of any specific issues. However, since this is the first
release of openrc-init, please test and report any issues you find.
