.Sh NAME
.Nm rc_find_pids
.Nd finds the pids of processes that match the given criteria
.Sh LIBRARY
Run Command library (librc, -lrc)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In rc.h
.Ft "RC_PIDLIST *" Fo rc_find_pids
.Fa "const char *const *argv"
.Fa "const char *cmd"
.Fa "uid_t uid"
.Fa "pid_t pid"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn rc_find_pids
returns RC_PIDLIST, a structure based on the LIST macro from
.Xr queue 3
which contains all the pids found matching the given criteria.
If
.Fa pid
is given then only that pid is returned if it is running. Otherwise we check
all instances of
.Fa argv
with a process name of
.Fa cmd
owned by
.Fa uid ,
all of which are optional.
.Pp
The returned list should be freed when done.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
On BSD systems we use
.Lb libkvm
and on Linux systems we use the
.Pa /proc
filesystem to find our processes.
.Pp
Each RC_PID should be freed in the list as well as the list itself when done.
