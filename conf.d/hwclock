# Set CLOCK to "UTC" if your Hardware Clock is set to UTC (also known as
# Greenwich Mean Time).  If that clock is set to the local time, then 
# set CLOCK to "local".  Note that if you dual boot with Windows, then 
# you should set it to "local".

# If you want to set the Hardware Clock to the current System Time 
# (software clock) during shutdown, then say "YES" here.
# You normally don't need to do this if you run a ntp daemon.

# If you want to set the system time to the current hardware clock
# during bootup, then say "YES" here. You do not need this if you are
# running a modern kernel with CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS set to y.
# Also, be aware that if you set this to "NO", the system time will
# never be saved to the hardware clock unless you set
# clock_systohc="YES" above.

# If you wish to pass any other arguments to hwclock during bootup,
# you may do so here. Alpha users may wish to use --arc or --srm here.
