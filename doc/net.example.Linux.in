# QUICK-START
#
# The quickest start is if you want to use DHCP.
# In that case, everything should work out of the box, no configuration
# necessary, though the startup script will warn you that you haven't
# specified anything.

# WARNING :- some examples have a mixture of IPv4 (ie 192.168.0.1) and IPv6
# (ie 4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab) internet addresses. They only work if you have
# the relevant kernel option enabled. So if you don't have an IPv6 enabled
# kernel then remove the IPv6 address from your config.

# If you want to use a static address or use DHCP explicitly, jump
# down to the section labeled INTERFACE HANDLERS.
#
# If you want to do anything more fancy, you should take the time to
# read through the rest of this file.


##############################################################################
# MODULES
#
# We now support modular networking scripts which means we can easily
# add support for new interface types and modules while keeping
# compatibility with existing ones.
#
# Modules load by default if the package they need is installed.  If
# you specify a module here that doesn't have its package installed
# then you get an error stating which package you need to install.
# Ideally, you only use the modules setting when you have two or more
# packages installed that supply the same service.
#
# In other words, you probably should DO NOTHING HERE...

# Prefer ifconfig over iproute2
#modules="!iproute2"

# You can also specify other modules for an interface
# In this case we prefer udhcpc over dhcpcd
#modules_eth0="udhcpc"

# You can also specify which modules not to use - for example you may be
# using a supplicant or linux-wlan-ng to control wireless configuration but
# you still want to configure network settings per SSID associated with.
#modules="!iwconfig !wpa_supplicant"
# IMPORTANT: If you need the above, please disable modules in that order


##############################################################################
# INTERFACE HANDLERS
#
# We provide two interface handlers presently: ifconfig and iproute2.
# You need one of these to do any kind of network configuration.
# For ifconfig support, emerge sys-apps/net-tools
# For iproute2 support, emerge sys-apps/iproute2

# If you don't specify an interface then we prefer iproute2 if it's installed
# To prefer ifconfig over iproute2
#modules="!iproute2"

# For a static configuration, use something like this
# (They all do exactly the same thing btw)
#config_eth0="192.168.0.2/24"
#config_eth0="192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0"

# If you need more than one address, you can use something like this
# NOTE: ifconfig creates an aliased device for each extra IPv4 address
#       (eth0:1, eth0:2, etc)
#       iproute2 does not do this as there is no need to
# WARNING: You cannot mix multiple addresses on a line with other parameters!
#config_eth0="192.168.0.2/24 192.168.0.3/24 192.168.0.4/24"
# However, that only works with CIDR addresses, so you can't use netmask.

# You can also use IPv6 addresses
# (you should always specify a prefix length with IPv6 here)
#config_eth0="192.168.0.2/24 4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab/64 4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ac/64"

# If you wish to keep existing addresses + routing and the interface is up,
# you can specify a noop (no operation). If the interface is down or there
# are no addresses assigned, then we move onto the next step (default dhcp)
# This is useful when configuring your interface with a kernel command line
# or similar
#config_eth0="noop 192.168.0.2/24"

# If you don't want ANY address (only useful when calling for advanced stuff)
#config_eth0="null"

# If you need to pass parameters to go with an address, you can do so on the
# same line as the address. You should split multiple addresses with newlines.
# WARNING: You cannot mix multiple addresses on a line with other parameters!
#config_eth0="192.168.0.2/24 scope host"
#config_eth0="4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab/64 nodad home preferred_lft 0"
#config_eth0="192.168.0.2/24 scope host
#4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab/64 nodad home preferred_lft 0"

# Here's how to do routing if you need it
# We add an IPv4 default route, IPv4 subnet route and an IPv6 unicast route
#routes_eth0="default via 192.168.0.1
#10.0.0.0/8 via 192.168.0.1
#::/0"

# If a specified module fails (like dhcp - see below), you can specify a
# fallback like so
#fallback_eth0="192.168.0.2/24"
#fallback_routes_eth0="default via 192.168.0.1"

# NOTE: fallback entry must match the entry location in config_eth0
# As such you can only have one fallback route.
# Also, if you do not set a fallback_routes entry for an interface, the
# routes entry will be used if that is set.

# Some users may need to alter the MTU - here's how
#mtu_eth0="1500"
# Same for TX Queue Length
#txqueuelen_eth0="1000"

# Each module described below can set a default base metric, lower is
# preferred over higher. This is so we can prefer a wired route over a
# wireless route automatically. You can override this by setting
#metric_eth0="100"
# or on a global basis
#metric="100"
# The only downside of the global setting is that you have to ensure that
# there are no conflicting routes yourself. For users with large routing
# tables you may have to set a global metric as the due to a simple read of
# the routing table taking over a minute at a time.

# Most drivers that report carrier status function correctly, but some do not
# One of these faulty drivers is for the Intel e1000 network card, but only
# at boot time. To get around this you may alter the carrier_timeout value for
# the interface. 0 is disable and any other number of seconds is how
# long we wait for carrier. The current default is disabled.
#carrier_timeout_eth0=0

# You may wish to disable the interface being brought down when stopping.
# This is only of use for WakeOnLan.
#ifdown_eth0="NO"

# OPTIONAL MODULES

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WIRELESS (802.11 support)
# Wireless can be provided by iwconfig or wpa_supplicant
# wpa_supplicant is preferred, use the modules directive to prefer iwconfig.
#modules="iwconfig"
#
# iwconfig
# emerge net-wireless/wireless-tools
###############################################
# HINTS
#
# Most users will just need to set the following options
# key_SSID1="s:yourkeyhere enc open" # s: means a text key
# key_SSID2="aaaa-bbbb-cccc-dd"      # no s: means a hex key
# preferred_aps="'SSID 1' 'SSID 2'"
#
# Clear? Good. Now configure your wireless network below

###############################################
# SETTINGS
# Hard code an SSID to an interface - leave this unset if you wish the driver
# to scan for available Access Points
# Set to "any" to connect to any SSID - the driver picks an Access Point
# This needs to be done when the driver doesn't support scanning
# This may work for drivers that don't support scanning but you need automatic
# AP association
# I would only set this as a last resort really - use the preferred_aps
# setting at the bottom of this file

# However, using ad-hoc (without scanning for APs) and master mode
# do require the SSID to be set - do this here
#essid_eth0="any"

# Set the mode of the interface (managed, ad-hoc, master or auto)
# The default is auto
# If it's ad-hoc or master you also may need to specify the channel below
#mode_eth0="auto"

# If managed mode fails, drop to ad-hoc mode with the below SSID?
#adhoc_essid_eth0="WLAN"

# Some drivers/hardware don't scan all that well. We have no control over this
# but we can say how many scans we want to do to try and get a better sweep of
# the area. The default is 1.
#scans_eth0="1"

#Channel can be set (1-14), but defaults to 3 if not set.
#
# The below is taken verbatim from the BSD wavelan documentation found at
# http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/network/wavelan.html
# There are 14 channels possible; We are told that channels 1-11 are legal for
# North America, channels 1-13 for most of Europe, channels 10-13 for France,
# and only channel 14 for Japan. If in doubt, please refer to the documentation
# that came with your card or access point. Make sure that the channel you
# select is the same channel your access point (or the other card in an ad-hoc
# network) is on. The default for cards sold in North America and most of Europe
# is 3; the default for cards sold in France is 11, and the default for cards
# sold in Japan is 14.
#channel_eth0="3"

# Setup any other config commands. This is basically the iwconfig argument
# without the iwconfig $iface.
#iwconfig_eth0=""

# Set private driver ioctls. This is basically the iwpriv argument without

#set WPAPSK=yourpasskey"
#NOTE: Even though you can use WPA like so, you may have to set a WEP key
#if your driver claims the AP is encrypted. The WEP key itself will not be
#used though.

# Seconds to wait before scanning
# Some drivers need to wait until they have finished "loading"
# before they can scan - otherwise they error and claim that they cannot scan
# or resource is unavailable. The default is to wait zero seconds
#sleep_scan_eth0="1"

# Seconds to wait until associated. The default is to wait 10 seconds.
# 0 means wait indefinitely. WARNING: this can cause an infinite delay when
# booting.
#associate_timeout_eth0="5"

# By default a successful association in Managed mode sets the MAC
# address of the AP connected to. However, some drivers (namely
# the ipw2100) don't set an invalid MAC address when association
# fails - so we need to check on link quality which some drivers
# don't report properly either.
# So if you have connection problems try flipping this setting
# Valid options are MAC, quality and all - defaults to MAC
#associate_test_eth0="MAC"

# Some driver/card combinations need to scan in Ad-Hoc mode
# After scanning, the mode is reset to the one defined above
#scan_mode_eth0="Ad-Hoc"

# Below you can define private ioctls to run before and after scanning
# Format is the same as the iwpriv_eth0 above
# This is needed for the HostAP drivers
#iwpriv_scan_pre_eth0="'host_roaming 2'"
#iwpriv_scan_post_eth0="'host_roaming 0'"

# Define a WEP key per SSID or MAC address (of the AP, not your card)

# To use a string, prefix it with s:
# Note - this example also sets the encryption method to open
# which is regarded as more secure than restricted

# "forceany" does the same as forcepreferred + connects to any other available AP
# Default is "any"
#associate_order="any"

# WIRELESS SSID IN VARIABLES
##############################################################################
# Remember to change SSID to your SSID.
# Say that your SSID is My NET - the line
#      #key_SSID="s:passkey"
# becomes
#      #key_My_NET="s:passkey"
# Notice that the space has changed to an underscore - do the same with all
# characters not in a-z A-Z (English alphabet) 0-9. This only applies to
# variables and not values.
#
# Any SSID's in values like essid_eth0="My NET" may need to be escaped
# This means placing the character \ before the character
# \" need to be escaped for example
# So if your SSID is
#      My "\ NET
# it becomes
#      My \"\\ NET
# for example
#      #essid_eth0="My\"\\NET"
#
# So using the above we can use
#      #dns_domain_My____NET="My\"\\NET"
# which is an invalid dns domain, but shows the how to use the variable

# DHCP
# DHCP can be provided by dhclient, dhcpcd, pump or udhcpc.
#
# dhclient: emerge net-misc/dhcp
# dhcpcd:   emerge net-misc/dhcpcd
# pump:     emerge net-misc/pump
# udhcpc:   emerge sys-apps/busybox

# If you have more than one DHCP client installed, you need to specify which
# one to use - otherwise we default to dhcpcd if available.
#modules="dhclient" # to select dhclient over dhcpcd
#
# Notes:
# - All clients send the current hostname to the DHCP server by default
# - dhcpcd does not daemonize when the lease time is infinite
# - udhcp-0.9.3-r3 and earlier do not support getting NTP servers
# - pump does not support getting NIS servers
# - DHCP tends to erase any existing device information - so add
#   static addresses after dhcp if you need them
# - dhclient and udhcpc can set other resolv.conf options such as "option"
#   and "sortlist"- see the System module for more details

# Regardless of which DHCP client you prefer, you configure them the
# same way using one of following depending on which interface modules
# you're using.
#config_eth0="dhcp"

# For passing custom options to dhcpcd use something like the following.  This
# example reduces the timeout for retrieving an address from 60 seconds (the
# default) to 10 seconds.
#dhcpcd_eth0="-t 10"

# dhclient, udhcpc and pump don't have many runtime options
# You can pass options to them in a similar manner to dhcpcd though
#dhclient_eth0="..."
#udhcpc_eth0="..."
#pump_eth0="..."

# GENERIC DHCP OPTIONS
# Set generic DHCP options like so
#dhcp_eth0="release nodns nontp nonis nogateway nosendhost"

# This tells the dhcp client to release its lease when it stops, not to
# overwrite dns, ntp and nis settings, not to set a default route and not to
# send the current hostname to the dhcp server and when it starts.
# You can use any combination of the above options - the default is not to
# use any of them.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# For APIPA support, emerge net-misc/iputils or net-analyzer/arping

# APIPA is a module that tries to find a free address in the range
# 169.254.0.0-169.254.255.255 by arping a random address in that range on the

# For link bonding/trunking on 2.4 kernels, or kernels without sysfs
# emerge net-misc/ifenslave

# To bond interfaces together
#slaves_bond0="eth0 eth1 eth2"
#config_bond0="null" # You may not want to assign an IP the the bond

# Please note, that you should generally NOT try to change the MAC addresses of
# a bond interface yourself. If you do so, the kernel and your network switches
# may not work quite right. It is permissible to set the MAC addresses of bond
# slaves BEFORE the bond comes up, but not after the bond is up (it will change
# MAC addresses of the slaves on it's own).

# You can also configure the parameters of the bond here, which must be done
# via sysfs on 2.6 kernels or newer. The description of all the options can be
# found in the kernel: /usr/src/linux-*/Documentation/networking/bonding.txt
# You will probably want the 'mode' option at the least.
# Some possible parameters: mode fail_over_mac arp_validate arp_interval
# arp_ip_target downdelay updelay lacp_rate ad_select xmit_hash_policy
# num_grat_arp num_unsol_na miimon primary primary_reselect use_carrier

# Bonding subsume support (prevents crashes for root-on-NFS)
#  - Only tested in the default bonding mode ('active-backup') with
# IPv4
#  - Only subsumes basic interface characteristics (IP, netmask) and
#    excludes additional routes, interface properties such as MTU,
#    interface-associated netfilter rules, etc.
# In the example below, the (usually kernel-autoconfigured)

#  where "peer_ip" is the IP address of a PVC peer (in case of an ATM connection
#  with your ISP, your only peer is usually the ISP gateway closest to you),
#  "if" is the number of the ATM interface which will carry the PVC, "vpi.vci"
#  is the ATM VC address, and "opts" may optionally specify VC parameters like
#  qos, pcr, and the like (see "atmarp -s" for further reference). Please also
#  note quoting: it is meant to distinguish the VCs you want to create. You may,
#  in example, create an atm0 interface to more peers, like this:
#clip_atm0="1.1.1.254,0.8.35 1.1.1.253,1.8.35"

#  By default, the PVC will use the LLC/SNAP encapsulation. If you rather need a

# Advanced Routing
# WARNING: For advanced routing you MUST be using sys-apps/iproute2

# This provides a means to do multi-homing and more using the Routing Policy
# Database (RPDB).
#
# See the following links for background and more information.
# http://linux-ip.net/html/ch-routing.html
# http://linux-ip.net/html/ch-advanced-routing.html

# The rules listed will be added with 'ip rule add LINE' when the interface is
# being brought up. They will also be removed with 'ip rule delete LINE'.
# The rules added are also stored for later removal, so if you alter your rules
# directly before stopping, you should review your rules again after stopping.

# Note in earlier versions of openrc, this was provided as an example in
# postup/postdown, however that implementation suffered some bugs in corner
# cases, which are now fixed with this merger. If you used the previous
# example, you should only need to drop the relevent portions of your
# postup/postdown functions, and review the quoting in your rules_IFACE
# variables.

# Below is a trivial example for a dual-homed connection where there is an OOB
# management network. Only packets explicitly with an address from or to the
# OOB are sent via eth0. All others go via eth1 as the eth1 rules have a lower
# priority.

# If you want to use names for your tables, you should put lines into
# /etc/iproute2/rt_tables, an example follows:
# 2 oob
# 3 external
#
# IPv6 RPDB entries are to be found in the rules6_IFVAR variables:

#rules_eth0="
#from ZZZ.ZZZ.200.128/27 table oob priority 500
#to ZZZ.ZZZ.200.128/27 table oob priority 550"
#rules_eth1="
#from XXX.XXX.112.0/24 table external priority 400
#to XXX.XXX.112.0/24 table external priority 450"
#routes_eth0="
#ZZZ.ZZZ.200.128/27 dev eth0 table oob scope link
#default via ZZZ.ZZZ.200.129 table oob"
#routes_eth1="
#XXX.XXX.112.0/24 dev eth1 table external scope link
#default via XXX.XXX.112.1 dev eth1"

# IPv6 example:

# (success) to indicate that configuration or deconfiguration of the
