# /etc/conf.d/consolefont

# CONSOLEFONT specifies the default font that you'd like Linux to use on the
# console.  You can find a good selection of fonts in /usr/share/consolefonts;
# you shouldn't specify the trailing ".psf.gz", just the font name below.
# To use the default console font, comment out the CONSOLEFONT setting below.
# This setting is used by the /etc/init.d/consolefont script (NOTE: if you do
# not want to use it, run "rc-update del consolefont" as root).
CONSOLEFONT="default8x16"

# CONSOLETRANSLATION is the charset map file to use.  Leave commented to use
# the default one.  Have a look in /usr/share/consoletrans for a selection of
# map files you can use.
#CONSOLETRANSLATION="8859-1_to_uni"

# UNICODEMAP is the unicode map file to use. Leave commented to use the
# default one. Have a look in /usr/share/unimaps for a selection of map files
# you can use.
