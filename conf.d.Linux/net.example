# QUICK-START
#
# The quickest start is if you want to use DHCP.
# In that case, everything should work out of the box, no configuration
# necessary, though the startup script will warn you that you haven't
# specified anything.

# WARNING :- some examples have a mixture of IPv4 (ie 192.168.0.1) and IPv6
# (ie 4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab) internet addresses. They only work if you have
# the relevant kernel option enabled. So if you don't have an IPv6 enabled
# kernel then remove the IPv6 address from your config.

# If you want to use a static address or use DHCP explicitly, jump
# down to the section labelled INTERFACE HANDLERS.
#
# If you want to do anything more fancy, you should take the time to
# read through the rest of this file.


##############################################################################
# VARIABLES
#
# We've changed from using arrays to evaluated strings.
# This has the benefit of being slightly more readable but more importantly it
# works across all shells.
# OLD
# config_eth0=( "192.168.0.24 netmask 255.255.255.0" "192.168.0.25/24" )
# NEW
# config_eth0="'192.168.0.24 netmask 255.255.255.0' 192.168.0.25/24"
# INVALID
# config_eth0='192.168.0.24 netmask 255.255.255.0'
#
# As the 1st value has spaces in it, it needs additional quoting. The 2nd
# value has no spaces, therefore no additional quoting is required.
# The last statement is invalid because when it is evaluated, it only has one
# set of quotes.

##############################################################################
# MODULES
#
# We now support modular networking scripts which means we can easily
# add support for new interface types and modules while keeping
# compatability with existing ones.
# 
# Modules load by default if the package they need is installed.  If
# you specify a module here that doesn't have it's package installed
# then you get an error stating which package you need to install.
# Ideally, you only use the modules setting when you have two or more
# packages installed that supply the same service.
#
# In other words, you probably should DO NOTHING HERE...

# Prefer ifconfig over iproute2
#modules="ifconfig"

# You can also specify other modules for an interface
# In this case we prefer udhcpc over dhcpcd
#modules_eth0="udhcpc"

# You can also specify which modules not to use - for example you may be
# using a supplicant or linux-wlan-ng to control wireless configuration but
# you still want to configure network settings per SSID associated with.
#modules="!iwconfig !wpa_supplicant"
# IMPORTANT: If you need the above, please disable modules in that order


##############################################################################
# INTERFACE HANDLERS
# 
# We provide two interface handlers presently: ifconfig and iproute2.
# You need one of these to do any kind of network configuration.
# For ifconfig support, emerge sys-apps/net-tools
# For iproute2 support, emerge sys-apps/iproute2

# If you don't specify an interface then we prefer iproute2 if it's installed
# To prefer ifconfig over iproute2
#modules="ifconfig"

# For a static configuration, use something like this
# (They all do exactly the same thing btw)
#config_eth0="192.168.0.2/24"
#config_eth0="'192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0'"

# We can also specify a broadcast
#config_eth0="'192.168.0.2/24 brd 192.168.0.255'"
#config_eth0="'192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255'"

# If you need more than one address, you can use something like this
# NOTE: ifconfig creates an aliased device for each extra IPv4 address
#       (eth0:1, eth0:2, etc)
#       iproute2 does not do this as there is no need to
#config_eth0="'192.168.0.2/24' '192.168.0.3/24' '192.168.0.4/24'"
# Or you can use sequence expressions
#config_eth0="192.168.0.{2..4}/24" # FIXME - does it work?
# which does the same as above. Be careful though as if you use this and
# fallbacks, you have to ensure that both end up with the same number of
# values otherwise your fallback won't work correctly.

# You can also use IPv6 addresses
# (you should always specify a prefix length with IPv6 here)
#config_eth0="192.168.0.2/24 \
#4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab/64 \
#4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ac/64"
#)

# If you wish to keep existing addresses + routing and the interface is up,
# you can specify a noop (no operation). If the interface is down or there
# are no addresses assigned, then we move onto the next step (default dhcp)
# This is useful when configuring your interface with a kernel command line
# or similar
#config_eth0="noop 192.168.0.2/24"

# If you don't want ANY address (only useful when calling for advanced stuff)
#config_eth0="null"

# Here's how to do routing if you need it
# We add an IPv4 default route, IPv4 subnet route and an IPv6 unicast route
#routes_eth0=" \
#	'default via 192.168.0.1' \
#	'10.0.0.0/8 via 192.168.0.1' \
#	'::/0' \
#"

# If a specified module fails (like dhcp - see below), you can specify a
# fallback like so
#fallback_eth0="'192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0'"
#fallback_route_eth0="'default via 192.168.0.1'"

# NOTE: fallback entry must match the entry location in config_eth0
# As such you can only have one fallback route.

# Some users may need to alter the MTU - here's how
#mtu_eth0="1500"

# Each module described below can set a default base metric, lower is
# preferred over higher. This is so we can prefer a wired route over a
# wireless route automaticaly. You can override this by setting
#metric_eth0="100"
# or on a global basis
#metric="100"
# The only downside of the global setting is that you have to ensure that
# there are no conflicting routes yourself. For users with large routing
# tables you may have to set a global metric as the due to a simple read of
# the routing table taking over a minute at a time.

###############################################
# SETTINGS
# Hard code an SSID to an interface - leave this unset if you wish the driver
# to scan for available Access Points
# Set to "any" to connect to any SSID - the driver picks an Access Point
# This needs to be done when the driver doesn't support scanning
# This may work for drivers that don't support scanning but you need automatic
# AP association
# I would only set this as a last resort really - use the preferred_aps

# However, using ad-hoc (without scanning for APs) and master mode
# do require the SSID to be set - do this here

#Channel can be set (1-14), but defaults to 3 if not set.
#
# The below is taken verbatim from the BSD wavelan documentation found at
# http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/network/wavelan.html
# There are 14 channels possible; We are told that channels 1-11 are legal for
# North America, channels 1-13 for most of Europe, channels 10-13 for France,
# and only channel 14 for Japan. If in doubt, please refer to the documentation
# that came with your card or access point. Make sure that the channel you
# select is the same channel your access point (or the other card in an ad-hoc
# network) is on. The default for cards sold in North America and most of Europe
# is 3; the default for cards sold in France is 11, and the default for cards
# sold in Japan is 14.

#
# Any SSID's in values like essid_eth0="My NET" may need to be escaped

# \" need to be escaped for example
# So if your SSID is
#      My "\ NET
# it becomes
#      My \"\\ NET
# for example
#      #essid_eth0="My\"\\NET"

# DHCP
# DHCP can be provided by dhclient, dhcpcd, pump or udhcpc.
#
# dhclient: emerge net-misc/dhcp
# dhcpcd:   emerge net-misc/dhcpcd
# pump:     emerge net-misc/pump
# udhcpc:   emerge net-misc/udhcp

# If you have more than one DHCP client installed, you need to specify which
# one to use - otherwise we default to dhcpcd if available.
#modules=( "dhclient" ) # to select dhclient over dhcpcd
#
# Notes:
# - All clients send the current hostname to the DHCP server by default
# - dhcpcd does not daemonize when the lease time is infinite
# - udhcp-0.9.3-r3 and earlier do not support getting NTP servers 
# - pump does not support getting NIS servers
# - DHCP tends to erase any existing device information - so add
#   static addresses after dhcp if you need them
# - dhclient and udhcpc can set other resolv.conf options such as "option"
#   and "sortlist"- see the System module for more details

# Regardless of which DHCP client you prefer, you configure them the
# same way using one of following depending on which interface modules
# you're using.
#config_eth0="dhcp"

# For passing custom options to dhcpcd use something like the following.  This
# example reduces the timeout for retrieving an address from 60 seconds (the
# default) to 10 seconds.

# dhclient, udhcpc and pump don't have many runtime options
# You can pass options to them in a similar manner to dhcpcd though

#pump_eth0="..."

# GENERIC DHCP OPTIONS
# Set generic DHCP options like so
#dhcp_eth0="release nodns nontp nonis nogateway nosendhost"

# This tells the dhcp client to release it's lease when it stops, not to
# overwrite dns, ntp and nis settings, not to set a default route and not to
# send the current hostname to the dhcp server and when it starts.
# You can use any combination of the above options - the default is not to
# use any of them.

#  is the ATM VC address, and "opts" may optionally specify VC parameters like
#  qos, pcr, and the like (see "atmarp -s" for further reference). Please also
#  note quoting: it is meant to distinguish the VCs you want to create. You may,
#  in example, create an atm0 interface to more peers, like this:
#clip_atm0="'1.1.1.254 0.8.35' 1.1.1.253 1.8.35'"

#  By default, the PVC will use the LLC/SNAP encapsulation. If you rather need a
#  null encapsulation (aka "VC mode"), please add the keyword "null" to opts.

# PPP
# For PPP support, emerge net-dialup/ppp
# PPP is used for most dialup connections, including ADSL.
# The older ADSL module is documented below, but you are encouraged to try
# this module first.

# Each PPP interface requires an interface to use as a "Link"
#link_ppp0="/dev/ttyS0" 		# Most PPP links will use a serial port
#link_ppp0="eth0"       		# PPPoE requires an ethernet interface
#link_ppp0="[itf.]vpi.vci"		# PPPoA requires the ATM VC's address
#link_ppp0="/dev/null"			# ISDN links should have this
#link_ppp0="pty 'your_link_command'"	# PPP links over ssh, rsh, etc

# Here you should specify what pppd plugins you want to use
# Available plugins are: pppoe, pppoa, capi, dhcpc, minconn, radius,
#			 radattr, radrealms and winbind 
#plugins_ppp0="pppoe"			# Required plugin for PPPoE
#plugins_ppp0="pppoa vc-encaps"		# Required plugin for PPPoA with an option

# This is most benefit to wireless users who don't use DHCP so they can change
# their configs based on SSID.

# NOTE: Setting any of these will stamp on the files in question. So if you
# don't specify dns_servers but you do specify dns_domain then no nameservers
# will be listed in /etc/resolv.conf even if there were any there to start
# with.
# If this is an issue for you then maybe you should look into a resolv.conf
# manager like resolvconf-gentoo to manage this file for you. All packages
# that baselayout supports use resolvconf-gentoo if installed.

# Cable in/out detection
# Sometimes the cable is in, others it's out. Obviously you don't want to

#
# netplug is a package that detects this and requires no extra configuration
# on your part.
# emerge sys-apps/netplug
# or
# emerge sys-apps/ifplugd
# and you're done :)

# By default we don't wait for netplug/ifplugd to configure the interface.
# If you would like it to wait so that other services now that network is up
# then you can specify a timeout here.
#plug_timeout="10"
# A value of 0 means wait forever.

# If you don't want to use netplug on a specific interface but you have it
# installed, you can disable it for that interface via the modules statement

# You can do the same for ifplugd
#
# You can disable them both with the generic plug
#modules_eth0="!plug"

# To use specific ifplugd options, fex specifying wireless mode
#ifplugd_eth0="--api-mode=wlan"
# man ifplugd for more options

# The return values for the preup and predown functions should be 0
# (success) to indicate that configuration or deconfiguration of the
# interface can continue.  If preup returns a non-zero value, then

# non-zero value, then the interface will not be allowed to continue
# deconfiguration.
